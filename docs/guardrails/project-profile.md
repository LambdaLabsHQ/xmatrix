# Project Profile

This file is a descriptive snapshot, not policy. The only canonical project rules are the ten P0/P1/P2 guardrails in `project-guardrails.md`; statements here and in the linked snapshots document the current implementation and cannot add or override a guardrail.

## Overview

This repository implements xMatrix, the multi-agent coordination/runtime layer. xMatrix is a multi-agent coordination system for AI coding agents and humans. It connects agents such as Codex, Claude Code, Kimi, Cursor, Aider, and Windsurf through shared channels backed by a relay hub. The same repository ships the Web dashboard, Cloudflare Hub, Rust CLI/daemon, protocol package, native shells, release automation, and deployment scripts.

Agents run on the subscriptions and credentials their users supply; Space
billing is independent of compute.

## Default Documentation Language

English is the default language for repository documentation, guardrails, release docs, and tool instructions. Chinese may be used for existing Chinese design notes or when maintainers explicitly ask for Chinese output.

## Current behavior

The component map is `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`. The rest of this snapshot is split into the files below. They keep the previous text.

- [Repository map](profile-repository-map.md)
- [Architecture boundaries](profile-architecture-boundaries.md)
- [Public interfaces and domain contracts](profile-public-interfaces.md)
- [Security-sensitive areas](profile-security.md)
- [SQL, clients, and local replicas](profile-clients.md)

Message syntax and execution selection use the [message interaction protocol](../design/message-interaction-protocol.md), with a shared TypeScript/Rust grammar and domain-owned authorization.

Machine startup failures remain visible as idempotent Channel notices even if
the Launch has already failed its Run. Public invocation details classify known
repository preparation errors with actionable copy; subsequent stop cleanup
preserves the failed-startup outcome. See [invocation status](../design/mention-invocation/README.md).

Teams native integration uses a company home-tenant Bot, Human admin confirmation and primary PostgreSQL room grants, alongside explicit outbound-only manual webhooks. Its supported scope, canonical release configuration and evidence requirements are documented in [Teams native contract](../connectors/teams-native.md). Company identity and native acceptance remain external prerequisites.
